Hello everyone this is a simple discord bot that you can use to forward your files or text to 
telegram from your discord channel...


Here are some tips that i want to give you before using the script.

    1. This script can be used to send the document file to telegram form discord
    2. Also you can send the text of the msg.
    3. The script uses the webhook technique to forward 

Some tips using the keep_alive file.

    1. First of all you need to go to the https://uptimerobot.com/ and creat account.
    2. This is required that replit can only keep your bot alive for 1 hour if no iteraction 
        made with the bot. 
    3. So to avoid intereption we need to use the uptime robot that will ping our bot 
        every 5 minutes. 
    4. After creating acount on the uptimerobot 
        a. Go to your dashboard 
        b. Then click on the add a new monitor on the left side.
        c. In the monitor type click on the https 
        d. then it a name what ever you want 
        e. after that you have to give it the url which is very important
            You can get the url from the replit site 
            whenever you run your script a webview will open with a url like 
                https://botname.accountname.repl.co
            copy this url and paste it in the url section in uptimerobot.
        f. After that just click on the create monitor button 
        g. again click on the same button whatever appear their 
            And you are ready to go...........
